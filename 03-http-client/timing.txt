Keep-Alive connection is on average ~19.63% faster than close connection

This makes sense since HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive reuses the TCP connection for each request which avoids repeated connection setup.
Having a bigger sample size should make more sense as the first run for close connection was a lot faster than the 2 following.
